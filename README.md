# Hark! #
---------

## Hark is your personal radio station. Podcasts. Radio. Revolutionized. ##

This will be filled in with more information as I have the time to update it. For now, know that Hark is a NodeJS-powered podcast manager that lives in the cloud and lets you keep all your podcasts in one place. It's beautiful, it's fast, and it's free.

***You can get an account right now at [Hark](http://harkhq.com).***

*Current version: 1.4.3. Updated January 31, 2013.*

## Technologies ##

Hark is based on the following:

* NodeJS
  * Lots of modules... see [app.js](https://github.com/joelhans/Hark/blob/master/app.js)
* ExpressJS
* Compass/SASS
* jPlayer

## License ##

Hark is, at the moment, under the MIT license. This may change, so keep your eyes open if you're using Hark in some meaningful way. That said, there's nothing stopping someone from launching a Hark-based service on their own VPS as a Hark competitor. The challenge is figuring out how to get it running, because I don't particularly feel like writing up the installation step-by-step. *Have fun hacking!*
