  h3#faq-feeds-1 How do I add a podcast subscription?
  p The best way to subscribe to podcasts is via the <a href="http://listen.harkhq.com/directory">Hark Directory</a>. One can find new content via the various categories on the left-hand site of the page, and click the large "Subscribe" button to get all the content. While this is the preferred method of subscribing...
  p Hark also lets you subscribe to podcasts using Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds. Every good podcast producer will supply an up-to-date RSS feed for their content. When you find the RSS feed, you can copy its location (for example: http://my-favorite-podcast.com/rss) into the input box that appears when you click on the "Add" button in Hark's main interface.
  p Sometimes, they can be difficult to find. One way to find RSS feeds is to search the page (Control+F) for the keyword "RSS." Oftentimes, podcast producers will symbolize a link to an RSS feed with its <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/43/Feed-icon.svg/128px-Feed-icon.svg.png" alt="RSS logo">logo.</a>

  h3#faq-feeds-2 How do I remove a podcast subscription?
  p In the left navigation column on the <a href="/listen">main interface page</a>, there is a list of your current podcast subscriptions. In order to remove one of those from your list, and to not receive any more content as it becomes available, hover over the item and click on the gear icon that appears. A new menu will appear under the item. Simply click on the "Remove" link to unsubscribe.

  h3#faq-feeds-3 How do I update my podcasts?
  p Unfortunately, Hark does not currently allow for subscriptions to be updated automatically. In order to get all the newest content, simply click the "Update" button on the main interface.

  h3#faq-feeds-4 Can I change the name of a subscription?
  p Yes. In the left navigation column on the <a href="/listen">main interface page</a>, there is a list of your current podcast subscriptions. In order to change the name of a podcast you subscribe to, hover over the item and click on the gear icon that appears. A new menu will appear under the item. Simply click on the "Edit" link to bring up an text box in which you can type your preferred name. Then hit "Enter."

Simply click on the "Delete" link to remove your subsciption.

  h3#faq-feeds-6 Does Hark support video podcasts?
  p Yes, Hark does support video podcasts, as of version 1.1, which was released on October 5. You can subscribe to video podcasts in exactly the same way you would audio-only podcasts. When you play a video, it will appear in the middle of the Hark interface, along with various controls to minimize and move the video around the screen.

  h2#faq-directory I need help with the Hark Directory.
  ul 
    li
      a(href="#faq-directory-1") How do I find podcasts that interest me?
    li
      a(href="#faq-directory-2") How do I subscribe to a podcast?
    li
      a(href="#faq-directory-3") I can't find a podcast.
    li
      a(href="#faq-directory-4") I want to add my podcast to the Directory.

  h3#faq-directory-1 How do I find podcasts that interest me?
  p As of version 1.1.1 (October 5, 2012), the best way to find podcasts that match your interests is to look through the various categories that the Hark Directory offers. If you're interested in technology podcasts, there is a category devoted to those offerings, along with sub-categories that break things down in more detail.
  p If you're looking for the best-of-the-best podcasts, try looking through the "Hark Picks." This is a curated list &mdash; from Hark's main developer &mdash; of only the highest-quality podcasts.
  p In the future, Hark will also feature a search function, along with more options to sort podcasts by most recently updated and popularity.

  h3#faq-directory-2 How do I subscribe to a podcast?
  p When you find a podcast that appeals to you, subscribing is as simple as clicking the rather large "Subscribe" button. When you go back to the "Listen" page, you'll already be subscribed. The lastest podcast will appear on your main feed, while older episodes will appear in the page built specifically for that podcast.

  h3#faq-directory-3 I can't find a podcast.
  p Sorry! While the Hark Directory is always growing, it's not complete by any means. The best way to get a podcast added to the directory is to send Hark an <a href="mailto:admin@harkhq.com">e-mail</a>.

  h3#faq-directory-4 I want to add my podcast to the Directory.
  p Great &mdash; that's as easy as sending Hark an <a href="mailto:admin@harkhq.com">e-mail</a>. Make sure that you have an RSS feed for the podcast feeds alone. While Hark is really great at parsing through RSS for exactly the information it needs, it can't do everything. Without a good RSS feed, inclusion into the Hark Directory is unlikely.

  h2#faq-account I need help with my Hark account.
  ul 
    li
      a(href="#faq-account-1") Why claim a username?
    li
      a(href="#faq-account-2") How do I delete my account?

  h3#faq-account-1 Why claim a username?
  p Right now, claiming a username is, essentially, meaningless. In the future, Hark may support user profiles and more "social" features, so it may be nice to claim the username of your choice. There are no consequences to <em>not</em> doing that, so don't feel compelled.

  h3#faq-account-2 How do I delete my account?
  p Deleting your account, and <em>all</em> of the data associated with it, is very simple. Just click on the "Goodbye, podcasts!" button that appears in the <a href="/help">help</a> page. You will be promted to make sure that you really do want to delete your account. If you do, your data will be permenantly deleted.

  h2#more-help What if I need more help?
