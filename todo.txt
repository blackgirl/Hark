ROADMAP

  0.1
  ----------
  [x] --  Add the ability to edit the name of feeds.
  [x] --  Download, link-through buttons for each feed.
  [x] --  A functional description section for each podcast.
  [x] --  Functioning cookies/session management.
            * Mostly, this requires a way to route logged-in users from /login 
              to /listen.
          Bug fixes.
            [x] --  Left column doesn't get tall enough to accomodate many many feeds.

  0.2
  ----------
  [x] --  Sorting abilities for podcasts (date, feed, etc).
            [x] --  By date.
            [x] --  By feed.
            [x] --  By podcast name.
            [x] --  Ascending/descending arrows.
  [x] --  Sync reset when the user is done listening to a feed.
  [x] --  Added "HarkHQ" to project.
          Bug fixes.
            [x] --  Listen syncing doesn't appear to work all that well.
            [x] --  Auto-marking as "listened" seems to have broken.
            [x] --  The "playing" data should reset/disappear at the end of a pocast.
            [x] --  Marking as "listened" while in an individual feed listing should just un-bold the item, not disappear it.
            [x] --  Podcast descriptions don't work in the "single" view.
            [x] --  New users couldn't access the site due to the "listening" local that was passed to Jade templates.

  0.3
  ----------
  [ ] --  Better responsiveness in UI.
            * Will mostly entail more catches for small/mobile screens.
  [ ] --  SSL encryption.
          Bug fixes.
            [x] --  Added sorting features to single feed view.

  0.4
  ----------
  [ ] --  Categories
            * Users will be able to "tag" podcasts for certain categories (technology, design, etc).
            * Or, they will be able to drag-and-drop them into buckets.
            * Maybe both.

  1.0
  ----------
  [ ] --  A "Hark Directory"
            * This will be a central location for feeds.
            * I will be able to add new feeds to this database, and users will 
              be able to browse/search for items that they're interested in.

  2.0
  ----------
  [ ] --  "Harks": Personalized podcast streams.
            * Users will be able to select certain feeds they want to bundle together, maybe share them.
            * Someone can make a "best comedy podcasts" Hark, others can subscribe to that.


BUGS

  ****
  ----------

  ***
  ----------
  [ ] --  When reading podcast descriptions, the left column height doesn't get reset properly.
  [ ] --  Columns for individual podcasts don't line up upon resizing.
            * (Column height - 24px) / 2 = amount of padding above/below paragraph element.

  **
  ----------
  [ ] --  Account deletion doesn't route the user back home once it's done.
  [ ] --  Rapid-click on "mark as listened" causes some to not have successful POSTs. (Web sockets?)

  *
  ----------


OTHER FEATURES

Allow people to "bookmark" various points in a podcast and append them with notes, etc.

When listening to a podcast, make some kind of "pulse" on its feed in the left column.

Turn the getFeeds function into a cursor.each one like the updateFeeds one. Should be quicker.

Sanitize inputs.
  * Login -- user e-mails.
  * Feeds -- How to prevent maliciousness?

Add being able to load in older, non-databased feeds from the individual feed view.

Migrate application.js from use of "live" click handlers to "delegate."
