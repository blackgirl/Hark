ROADMAP

  0.1
  ----------
  [x] --  Add the ability to edit the name of feeds.
  [x] --  Download, link-through buttons for each feed.
  [x] --  A functional description section for each podcast.
  [x] --  Functioning cookies/session management.
            * Mostly, this requires a way to route logged-in users from /login 
              to /listen.
          Bug fixes.
            [x] --  Left column doesn't get tall enough to accomodate many many feeds.

  0.2
  ----------
  [x] --  Sorting abilities for podcasts (date, feed, etc).
            [x] --  By date.
            [x] --  By feed.
            [x] --  By podcast name.
            [x] --  Ascending/descending arrows.
  [x] --  Sync reset when the user is done listening to a feed.
  [x] --  Added "HarkHQ" to project.
          Bug fixes.
            [x] --  Listen syncing doesn't appear to work all that well.
            [x] --  Auto-marking as "listened" seems to have broken.
            [x] --  The "playing" data should reset/disappear at the end of a pocast.
            [x] --  Marking as "listened" while in an individual feed listing should just un-bold the item, not disappear it.
            [x] --  Podcast descriptions don't work in the "single" view.
            [x] --  New users couldn't access the site due to the "listening" local that was passed to Jade templates.

  0.3
  ----------
  [x] --  Better responsiveness in UI.
            * Will mostly entail more catches for small/mobile screens.
  [-] --  SSL encryption.
          Bug fixes.
            [x] --  Added sorting features to single feed view.
            [x] --  Columns for individual podcasts don't line up upon resizing.
            [x] --  Canvas-based waves look a little nicer now, save for resizing.
            [x] --  Updating feeds with multiple new items causes some problems, notably only marking all but the newest one unlistened, or none at all.

  0.4 // CURRENT LIVE VERSION ON HARKHQ.COM
  ----------
  [x] --  Migrate application.js from use of "live" click handlers to "delegate."
  [x] --  Adding feeds now inserts up to 50 items.
  [x] --  Manual sync.
          Bug fixes.
            [x] --  Updating feeds with multiple new items causes some problems, notably only marking all but the newest one unlistened, or none at all.
            [x] --  If you resume a podcast via syncing, it won't properly get marked as "listened" upon completion.

  0.5
  ----------
  [x] --  New planned interface for manipulating podcasts (Gmail-esque).
          Bug fixes.
            [x] --  Squashed a bug relating to updating of feeds with only a single item.
            [x] --  Fixed a rather embarassing bug that prevented users from adding podcasts.
            [x] --  Auto-hiding of listened podcasts is broken. I'm guessing it has to do with recent changes in mediaData's structure.
            [x] --  Playing data for a sync-ed podcast doesn't show. Same reason as above.
            [x] --  An RSS source that is down will no longer bring the updating process to a halt.

BUGS

  ****
  ----------
  [ ] --  1.0B02 -- "Momentize" isn't being properly called upon AJAX loading (for "All" feeds). It's also slow.
                    * What's up with "Uncaught ReferenceError: SBN is not defined"?
                    * Something to do with History.JS, I think.
                    * Might also want to look into pjax to simplify this.
                    * https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax
  [ ] --  1.0B03 -- Incorporate differentiator between listened/not-listened items in single view.
  [ ] --  1.0B04 -- Scrollbars don't work properly when switching between directory and listen, for example.
  [ ] --  1.0B11 -- Add feed input is hidden due to overflow-x on the sidebar element.
                    * Just make it appear under the "Add" item. No position: absolute.
  [ ] --  1.0B12 -- Need a new logo!
                    * Check the upper-left version, and the log-in, sign-up version. Check in FF, too.

  ***
  ----------
  [ ] --  1.0B05 -- Add a hover effect so people know they're hovering over a podcast title link.
  [ ] --  1.0B06 -- Update the 404 to be styled like the new Hark.
  [ ] --  1.0B07 -- Title is not updated when navigating via AJAX.
                    * Might also want to look into pjax to simplify this.
                    * https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax

  **
  ----------
  [ ] --  1.0B08 -- Incorporate some kind of loading screen for loading the main screen. It's a bit slow.
  [ ] --  1.0B09 -- Add in some kind of animation for remaining podcast items when you mark one as "read."
  [ ] --  1.0B10 -- The "source" links in some feeds don't work. Maybe convert to GUID?

  *
  ----------
  [ ] --  Rapid-click on "mark as listened" causes some to not have successful POSTs. (Web sockets?)

OTHER POSSIBLE FEATURES

Allow people to "bookmark" various points in a podcast and append them with notes, etc.
  * Use something similar to YouTube's timestamp?

When listening to a podcast, make some kind of "pulse" on its feed in the left column.

Turn the getFeeds function into a cursor.each one like the updateFeeds one. Should be quicker.

Sanitize inputs.
  * Login -- user e-mails.
  * Feeds -- How to prevent maliciousness?
