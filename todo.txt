  [x] --  Download, link-through buttons for each feed.
  [x] --  A functional description section for each podcast.
  [x] --  Functioning cookies/session management.
            * Mostly, this requires a way to route logged-in users from /login 
              to /listen.
          Bug fixes.
            [x] --  Left column doesn't get tall enough to accomodate many many feeds.

  0.2
  ----------
  [x] --  Sorting abilities for podcasts (date, feed, etc).
            [x] --  By date.

            [x] --  By podcast name.
            [x] --  Ascending/descending arrows.
  [x] --  Sync reset when the user is done listening to a feed.
  [x] --  Added "HarkHQ" to project.
          Bug fixes.
            [x] --  Listen syncing doesn't appear to work all that well.
            [x] --  Auto-marking as "listened" seems to have broken.
            [x] --  The "playing" data should reset/disappear at the end of a pocast.
            [x] --  Marking as "listened" while in an individual feed listing should just un-bold the item, not disappear it.
            [x] --  Podcast descriptions don't work in the "single" view.
            [x] --  New users couldn't access the site due to the "listening" local that was passed to Jade templates.

  0.3
  ----------
  [x] --  Better responsiveness in UI.
            * Will mostly entail more catches for small/mobile screens.
  [-] --  SSL encryption.
          Bug fixes.
            [x] --  Added sorting features to single feed view.
            [x] --  Columns for individual podcasts don't line up upon resizing.
            [x] --  Canvas-based waves look a little nicer now, save for resizing.
            [x] --  Updating feeds with multiple new items causes some problems, notably only marking all but the newest one unlistened, or none at all.

  0.4 // CURRENT LIVE VERSION ON HARKHQ.COM

            [x] --  Fixed a rather embarassing bug that prevented users from adding podcasts.
            [x] --  Auto-hiding of listened podcasts is broken. I'm guessing it has to do with recent changes in mediaData's structure.
            [x] --  Playing data for a sync-ed podcast doesn't show. Same reason as above.
            [x] --  An RSS source that is down will no longer bring the updating process to a halt.

OTHER POSSIBLE FEATURES

Look into pjax for simplified HTML History? https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax

Allow people to "bookmark" various points in a podcast and append them with notes, etc.
  * Use something similar to YouTube's timestamp?

Turn the getFeeds function into a cursor.each one like the updateFeeds one. Should be quicker.

Sanitize inputs.
  * Login -- user e-mails.
  * Feeds -- How to prevent maliciousness?
