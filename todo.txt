FEATURES

**** //	"Hark Directory"

***	 // Don't log out users who accidentally go back to the login page (cookies).

**   // When listening to a podcast, make some kind of "pulse" on its feed in the left column.

**   // Turn the getFeeds function into a cursor.each one like the updateFeeds one. Should be quicker.

**   // Sanitize inputs.
		- Login
			[ ] - User e-mails.
		- Listen
			[ ] - Feeds.
			    - Help sanitize adding RSS feeds by looking for an "http://" and adding it if it doesn't exist. (security?)

*   // Add being able to load in older, non-databased feeds from the individual feed view.

*    // Implement a kind of current "state" that allows for starting where you left off, etc.
		The problem with this is the state of HTML5 audio capability, Flash, servers, etc. It's probably not possible.

*    // Giving sort options on the initial view -- by date, by podcast, etc.

*	 // Migrate application.js from use of "live" click handlers to "delegate."

BUGS

**** // Left column doesn't get tall enough to accomodate many many feeds.

***	 // Account deletion doesn't route the user back home once it's done.

**   // Rapid-click on "mark as listened" causes some to not have successful POSTs.
