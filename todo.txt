ROADMAP

  0.1
  ----------
  [x] --  Add the ability to edit the name of feeds.
  [x] --  Download, link-through buttons for each feed.
  [x] --  A functional description section for each podcast.
  [x] --  Functioning cookies/session management.
            * Mostly, this requires a way to route logged-in users from /login 
              to /listen.
          Bug fixes.
            [x] --  Left column doesn't get tall enough to accomodate many many feeds.

  0.2
  ----------
  [x] --  Sorting abilities for podcasts (date, feed, etc).
            [x] --  By date.
            [x] --  By feed.
            [x] --  By podcast name.
            [x] --  Ascending/descending arrows.
  [x] --  Sync reset when the user is done listening to a feed.
  [ ] --  Better responsiveness in UI.
            * Will mostly entail more catches for small/mobile screens.
          Bug fixes.
            [x] --  Listen syncing doesn't appear to work all that well.

  1.0
  ----------
  [ ] --  A "Hark Directory"
            * This will be a central location for feeds.
            * I will be able to add new feeds to this database, and users will 
              be able to browse/search for items that they're interested in.


BUGS

[ ] --  Account deletion doesn't route the user back home once it's done.
[ ] --  Rapid-click on "mark as listened" causes some to not have successful POSTs. (Web sockets?)
[ ] --  Columns for individual podcasts don't line up upon resizing.
          * (Column height - 24px) / 2 = amount of padding above/below paragraph element.


OTHER FEATURES

Allow people to "bookmark" various points in a podcast and append them with notes, etc.

When listening to a podcast, make some kind of "pulse" on its feed in the left column.

Turn the getFeeds function into a cursor.each one like the updateFeeds one. Should be quicker.

Sanitize inputs.
  * Login -- user e-mails.
  * Feeds -- How to prevent maliciousness?

Add being able to load in older, non-databased feeds from the individual feed view.

Migrate application.js from use of "live" click handlers to "delegate."
