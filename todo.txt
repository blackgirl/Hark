ROADMAP
--------------------------------

  1.6
  ----------
  [ ] --  Have a variety of keyboard shortcuts for various important functions.
  [ ] --  Allow user to save listening progress in one podcast, listen to another one, and resume where they left off.
  [ ] --  Investigate a way to integrate the Directory individual pages with a user's own version. Is that even possible? At the very least, a check to show that a user is already subscribed.
  [ ] --  Add a Directory check to show when certain podcasts are already subscribed to.

  1.7
  ----------
  [ ] --  Categories
            * Users will be able to "tag" podcasts for certain categories (technology, design, etc).
            * Or, they will be able to drag-and-drop them into buckets.
            * Maybe both.

  1.8
  ----------
  [ ] --  "Harks": Personalized podcast streams/playlists.
            * Users will be able to select certain feeds they want to bundle together, maybe share them.
            * Someone can make a "best comedy podcasts" Hark, others can subscribe to that.

--------------------------------

  [x] --  Download, link-through buttons for each feed.
  [x] --  A functional description section for each podcast.
  [x] --  Functioning cookies/session management.
            * Mostly, this requires a way to route logged-in users from /login 
              to /listen.
          Bug fixes.
            [x] --  Left column doesn't get tall enough to accomodate many many feeds.

  [x] --  Added "HarkHQ" to project.
          Bug fixes.
            [x] --  Listen syncing doesn't appear to work all that well.
            [x] --  Auto-marking as "listened" seems to have broken.
            [x] --  The "playing" data should reset/disappear at the end of a pocast.
            [x] --  Marking as "listened" while in an individual feed listing should just un-bold the item, not disappear it.
            [x] --  Podcast descriptions don't work in the "single" view.
            [x] --  New users couldn't access the site due to the "listening" local that was passed to Jade templates.

  0.3
  ----------
  [x] --  Better responsiveness in UI.
            * Will mostly entail more catches for small/mobile screens.
  [-] --  SSL encryption.
          Bug fixes.
            [x] --  Added sorting features to single feed view.
            [x] --  Columns for individual podcasts don't line up upon resizing.
            [x] --  Canvas-based waves look a little nicer now, save for resizing.
            [x] --  Updating feeds with multiple new items causes some problems, notably only marking all but the newest one unlistened, or none at all.

  0.4

  [x] --  Adding feeds now inserts up to 50 items.
  [x] --  Manual sync.

            [x] --  Fixed a rather embarassing bug that prevented users from adding podcasts.
            [x] --  Auto-hiding of listened podcasts is broken. I'm guessing it has to do with recent changes in mediaData's structure.
            [x] --  Playing data for a sync-ed podcast doesn't show. Same reason as above.
            [x] --  An RSS source that is down will no longer bring the updating process to a halt.

    ----------
    [x] --  1.0B12 -- Error modals need to be fixed.
